## Notes

From this project, I learned that I need to plan even more before writing my code... This was especially a challenge because I didn't work on understanding the API response and was passing arguments to my functions willy-nilly, and this was all due to my inconsistency. It should make sense what I'm passing into these functions, and I should manipulate the data before passing it into my functions.

I scaled back on the deliverables because I found myself taking a lot of time to manipulate the data and this was, again, all due to poor planning. I have the gist of what this challenge is teaching, and I definitely learned a lot lol.

I also have to be careful on how I "start" off my logic. I found myself trapped in a situation where I was manipulating coordinates, but when a user searches with a zipcode or word, then I found myself having to look for another way to accept that query.
